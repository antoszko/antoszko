## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Stefan Antoszko, a 4th year Computer Engineering Student at the University of Alberta

ðŸ”­ During my free time I attend hackathons like NatHACKS and HackED or work on my musical synthesizer projects. My hackathons can be found at these repos:

- [Sleep Apnea Guardian](https://github.com/dreambigzhang/Sleep-Apnea-Guardian) * 1st place winners! *
- [Hexagonal Chess](https://github.com/stefan-png/hackedbeta22)
- [FindRoommate.com](https://github.com/dreambigzhang/FindRoommate.com)

ðŸŽ® I also have some other projects which can be found on [my personal github account](https://github.com/stefan-png):
- [BIGG game engine](https://github.com/stefan-png/BIGGEngine/tree/main) is a game engine written in C++ focused on using industry-standard libraries, robustness, and good documentation.


ðŸŽ¹ One of my hobbies is working with microcontrollers and discrete analog circuits to build a musical synthesizer! Here's my progress so far:
- I built a [programmer for a microcontroller](https://hackaday.io/project/195106-msp430-programmer-using-stm32) which allows me to program a tiny low-power MSP430 microcontroller.
- I used my custom programmer to [create a digital white noise source, then built an passive pink-noise filter to convert the white noise to pink noise!](https://hackaday.io/project/195199-pink-noise-generator) I derived the transfer function of the filter by hand and seleced standard components to minimize the error from the ideal -10dB/decade filter. Now it sounds just like a waterfall - perfect for relaxation!
- I've been working on a circuit for a simple synthesizer and have created and tested one PCB. I am now implementing changes and working on V2.

ðŸŽ¥ I also have some Youtube videos with some examples of my personal projects from the past.
- [ENCMP 100 Coding Competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ouzcBXrGYw): I won first place for an MS paint clone written in Matlab.
- [Vulkan C++ 3D Engine](https://youtu.be/LN4s6xCcLB8): a 3D ray-traced voxel engine prototype.

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm also interested in hiking in the Canadian rocky mountains, analog electronics, and international cuisine!
