## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Stefan Antoszko, a 3rd year Computer Engineering Student at the UofA

ðŸ”­ During my free time I attend hackathons like NatHACKS and HackED or work on my musical synthesizer projects. My hackathons can be found at these repos:

- [Sleep Apnea Guardian](https://github.com/dreambigzhang/Sleep-Apnea-Guardian) * 1st place winners! *
- [Hexagonal Chess](https://github.com/stefan-png/hackedbeta22)
- [FindRoommate.com](https://github.com/dreambigzhang/FindRoommate.com)

I also have some other projects which can be found here:
- [stefan-png](https://github.com/stefan-png) My second github account

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently building a programmer for a microcontroller which I plan to use to program a musical synthesizer

ðŸŽ¹ I'm also soldering the first prototype of my analog synth and making revision for v2

âš¡ Fun fact: I also am interested in hiking and the outdoors, analog electronics, and food!
